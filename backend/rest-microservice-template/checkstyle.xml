        IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING THIS FILE

        1.  Adding a new checkstyle rule requires FULL CONSENSUS. Every developer on the team should
            be added as reviewer to pull request and explicitly approve it.
            The same applies for changing rule configuration (except for bumping severity)
        2.  However to disable a rule, 2/3 majority is enough. Every developer still should be
            added as reviewer to PR, so that he is aware of the change and can voice his opinion.
        3.  Bumping severity from warning to error does not require.
        4.  Any change in this file must be done in a dedicated pull request - no source files
            should be added. Therefore when new rule is added while violations still exist in
            code, the process should be as follows:
             - In the first pull request, rule is added with "warning" severity
             - In one or more pull request, violations are cleaned from the codebase
             - Rule severity is bumped to "error" in a dedicated PR. Such PR does not require extra
               reviewers, consensus is considered expressed when the rule was originally added.

            merge conflicts between people with different settings.
